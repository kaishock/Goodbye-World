3. **Approach to testing** - _defining the test strategy to achieve the desired goals_

## II - Tests description

1. **Tested object** - _the product (e.g. application, software) to be tested_
  
  1.1 **Object**
  -   Functionalities to be tested
  
  1.2 **Object**
  -    Functionalities to be tested

2. **System requirements** - _configuration requirements for software and devices; environmental requirements_

4. **Outcome of a product planning process** - _the description of acceptance criteria for tested product_

## III - Management of the test process

1. **The project team** - _the list of all members of the project team, including their roles and way of contact_

2. **The testing team members** - _the list of members responsible for test efforts_

3. **Test tasks** - _sample list of test tasks_
  - Creating of test plan, along with test scenarios and test cases
  - The review process of the test plan
  - Obtaining the requirements for the project
  - Obtaining the requirements for the devices/software/tools
  - Conducting meeting to discuss project requirements
  - Conducting tests according to tesc cases and scenarios
  - Raporting defects
  - Conducting meeting about defects
  - Creating test report
 
4. **Test schedule** - _test deliveries and their schedule_
  - The list of test tasks with description
  - Initial assignment of tasks to testing team members

5. **Training needs** - _identification of training needs among testing team members_

6. **Environmental needs** - _listing the hardware and software components needed to complete the project; their availability and strategies in obtaining them_


  6.1 **Hardware and software components**
  - Devices (e.g. mobile phones)
  - Software (e.g. Linux)
  - Accesses (e.g. to database)

  6.2 **Test tools**
  - Defect management tools (e.g. Jira)
  - Test management tools (e.g. Xray, Test Rail)
  - Communication tools (np. Zoom, Mattermost)
  - Database frontend (e.g. MySQL Workbench)
  - API testing supporting tools (np. Postman, Swagger)
  - Code building tools and slots (np. Selenium)

7. **Project risk** - _identifying potential problems in the project_
  - inability to deliver the product by the development team
  - incorrect estimation of the severity of errors found during tests
  - lack of skills and people to conduct tests
  - problem with defining requirements

8. **Suspension and restart of testing** - _determining when testing should be suspended and when a suspended process should be restarted?_
  - Examples of reasons for testing suspension:
  -   Failure to meet the acceptance criteria
  -   Project cost miscalculated
  -  Examples of reasons for resuming testing:
  -   Change of acceptance criteria or meeting acceptance criteria after bug fixes
  -   Change of the project budget allowing to resume testing

9. **Defect tracking process** - _determining the method of bug tracking_
  - To ensure that the defect is not forgotten, it should be reported using the tools specified in the test plan

10. **Testing status tracking and reporting**
  - Test statutes should be tracked using the tools specified in the test plan. On their basis, the test team can prepare an appropriate report.
