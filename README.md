# About me
My name is **Kajetan Szokalski**. I am from Poland and have been working as a Software Tester since November 2020.

My motto is: _"The more you know, the faster you learn. The faster you learn, the more you know"_. 

I have been gaining first experience working for Skycash Poland since march 2021. Their main product is a mobile payment platform - application _Skycash_.

During this period, I have participated in projects in the following industries: public transport, rail transport, entertainment,

I have an ISTQB Foundation Level certificate.

## About this project
This GitHub project is to serve as my test portfolio and test repository.

I gained a large dose of knowledge about testing - both manual and automation - from open sources such as GitHub, Stackoverflow, YouTube.

I hope that this repository could help newcomers with their first steps in software testing.
