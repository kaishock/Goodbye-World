# About me
My name is **Kajetan Szokalski**. I am from Poland and have been working as a Software Tester since November 2020.

I have an ISTQB Foundation Level certificate and I have been gaining first experience working for Skycash Poland since march 2021. Their main product is a mobile payment platform - application _Skycash_.

## About this project
This GitHub project is to serve as my test portfolio and test repository.

I gained a large dose of knowledge about testing - both manual and automation - from open sources such as GitHub, Stackoverflow, YouTube.

I hope that this repository could help newcomers with their first steps in software testing.
