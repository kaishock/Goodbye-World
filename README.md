## About this project
This GitHub project is to serve as my test portfolio and test repository.

I gained a large dose of knowledge about testing - both manual and automation - from open sources as GitHub, Stackoverflow, YouTube.

I hope, that this repository could help others newcomers with their first steps in software testing.
