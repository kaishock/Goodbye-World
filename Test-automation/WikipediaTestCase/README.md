# Architecture of Test Cases

Caring about maintance of Test Case I keep different part of code in a few python files (main, page, locator, element).

Each file connects with each other as in attached picture. Test executions are in **main** file.

Such division was inspired by tutorial provided by [TechWithTim](https://www.youtube.com/c/TechWithTim)
